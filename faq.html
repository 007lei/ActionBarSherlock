	<dt>What action bar library is used on pre-3.0 devices?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The widget is called ActionBarWatson and it is a custom implementation that was purpose-built to mimic the API, functionality, and look of the native action bar on 3.0+ devices.</p>
		<p>ActionBarWatson is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/johannilsson/android-actionbar/pull/25">work done</a> on Johan Nilsson's <a href="https://github.com/johannilsson/android-actionbar">Android-ActionBar</a> library in order to provide styling compatibility with the native action bar. The first two versions of ActionBarSherlock used his library directly for support on pre-3.0 devices and without his work the current widget would not be possible.</p>
