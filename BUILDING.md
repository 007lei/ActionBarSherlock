Building ActionBarSherlock
==========================

If you would like to build a standalone JAR of `ActionBarSherlock` you can do so
using maven.


Prerequisites
-------------

Maven compilation requires that you have installed the Android SDK as well as
the compatibility library into your local maven repository. This can be done
automatically by the [SDK Deployer][1].

Follow the instructions on setting up the SDK Deployer and then execute the
following command in the SDK Deployer folder:

    mvn install -P 3.0

This will install the Android SDK 3.0 and the compatibility library into the
local repository.


Compiling
---------

Once the prerequisites have been successfully installed, building the JAR is
as easy as running `mvn clean package`. The final JAR will be located in the
`target/` folder.


Javadoc Generation
------------------

A javadoc site can be generated by executing `mvn javadoc:javadoc`. This
will compile a website of the documentation in the `target/site/apidocs/`
folder.
