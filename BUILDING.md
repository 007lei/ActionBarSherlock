Building ActionBarSherlock
==========================

The `ActionBarSherlock` library along with its sample applications are all built
using Apache Maven as well as Git for dependencies.

Maven will automate the process of compiling and assembling the JAR and APKs for
each project. If you want to use a development environment such as Eclipse, each
folder still maintains the standard Android project layout. By specifying the
desired folder as an existing source for a new Android project, you should be
able to successfully import the sources.

If you are working on a sample, you will still need to set up a project for the
library as well as one for the third-party action bar library, if needed.


Prerequisites
-------------

Maven compilation requires that you have installed the Android SDK as well as
the compatibility library into your local maven repository. This can be done
automatically by the [SDK Deployer][1].

Follow the instructions on setting up the SDK Deployer and then execute the
following command in the SDK Deployer folder:

    mvn install -P 3.0

This will install the Android SDK 3.0 and the compatibility library into the
local repository.

For the samples to build properly, you must install their third-party action
bar libraries. This can be automatically done by running
`python dependencies.py`. You will now have the vendor libraries in the
`vendor/` folder as well as their compiled libraries installed in your local
maven repository.


Compiling
---------

Once the prerequisites have been successfully installed, building is as easy
as running `mvn clean package`. The final JAR will be located in the
`library/target/` folder.

APKs for the samples are their respective `target/` folders.


Javadoc Generation
------------------

A javadoc site can be generated by executing `mvn javadoc:javadoc`. This
will compile a website of the documentation in the
`library/target/site/apidocs/` folder.
