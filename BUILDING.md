Building ActionBarSherlock
==========================

The `ActionBarSherlock` library along with its sample applications are all built
using Apache Maven as well as Git for dependencies. Maven will automate the
process of compiling and assembling the `jar`, `apklib`s, and `apk`s for each
project.


IDE
---

Even though the project uses maven, each folder within the repository still
maintains the standard Android project layout. By specifying the desired folder
as an existing source for a new Android project, you should be able to
successfully import the sources.


Prerequisites
-------------

Maven compilation requires that you have installed the Android SDK into your
local maven repository. This can be done automatically by the [SDK Deployer][1].

Follow the instructions on setting up the SDK Deployer. Then, execute the
following command in the SDK Deployer folder:

    mvn install -P 3.1

This will install the Android SDK 3.1 into the local repository.


Compiling
---------

Once the prerequisites have been successfully installed, building is as easy
as running `mvn clean package`. The final `.apklib` will be located in the
`library/target/` folder.

`apk`s for the samples are their respective `target/` folders.


Documentation Generation
------------------------

A documentation site can be generated by executing `mvn site`. This will
compile a website of the documentation in the `target/site/` folder.
