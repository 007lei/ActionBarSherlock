Building ActionBarSherlock
==========================

The `ActionBarSherlock` library along with its sample applications are all built
using Apache Maven as well as Git for dependencies. Maven will automate the
process of compiling and assembling the `jar`, `apklib`s, and `apk`s for each
project.


IDE
---

Even though the project uses maven, each folder within the repository still
maintains the standard Android project layout. By specifying the desired folder
as an existing source for a new Android project, you should be able to
successfully import the sources.

The order in which you should create the projects is as follows:

  1. `library/`
  2. `vendor/android-actionbar/actionbar` and/or `vendor/greendroid/GreenDroid/`
     - This will require that you have run
       the `dependencies.py` script previously.
  3. `handler-android-actionbar` and/or `handler-greendroid`
  4. Any of the sample projects.

Some of the projects have `.jar`s in their `libs/` folder which you must add to
the build path. You can do this by right-clicking on each one, selecting
'Add to build path' under the 'Build Path' sub-menu.


Prerequisites
-------------

Maven compilation requires that you have installed the Android SDK as well as
the compatibility library into your local maven repository. This can be done
automatically by the [SDK Deployer][3].

Follow the instructions on setting up the SDK Deployer. Make sure you have the
3.0 SDK, the Google APIs of the same revision, and the compatibility add-on.
Then, execute the following command in the SDK Deployer folder:

    mvn install -P 3.0

This will install the Android SDK 3.0 and the compatibility library into the
local repository.

For the samples to build properly, you must install their third-party action
bar libraries. This can be automatically done by running
`python dependencies.py`. You will now have the vendor libraries in the
`vendor/` folder as well as their compiled libraries installed in your local
maven repository.


Compiling
---------

Once the prerequisites have been successfully installed, building is as easy
as running `mvn clean package`. The final JAR will be located in the
`library/target/` folder.

`apk`s for the samples are their respective `target/` folders.


Javadoc Generation
------------------

A javadoc site can be generated by executing `mvn javadoc:javadoc`. This
will compile a website of the documentation in the
`library/target/site/apidocs/` folder.
