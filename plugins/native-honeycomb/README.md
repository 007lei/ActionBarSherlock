ActionBarSherlock Plugin: Native Honeycomb
==========================================

This plugin will enable the use of the native action bar on Android 3.x rather
than using the custom implementation.

Some of the features of the ICS action bar will not be available if this plugin
is used (e.g., programmatically changing icon/logo).
